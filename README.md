# online-table-booking-
A restaurant table booking system can be a great project for Python beginners to implement their programming skills. The goal of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly online system that allows customers to book tables at the restaurant. Here's a rough outline of what the project could include:

User registration and login: Users should be able to create an account and login to the system to make a table reservation.

Restaurant table booking: Customers should be able to browse through the available tables, select the one they want to book, and provide the necessary information such as date, time, number of guests, etc.

Confirmation and notification: Once the booking is complete, the user should receive a confirmation message with the details of their booking. The restaurant staff should also be notified of the booking so that they can prepare the table accordingly.

Admin dashboard: Restaurant managers should have access to an admin dashboard where they can manage the bookings, view customer details, and update the table availability.

Payment integration: Optionally, you can also integrate a payment system to allow customers to pay for their bookings online.

To implement this project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of web development using Python. You can use web frameworks like Flask or Django to build the system. You'll also need to work with databases to store user information, table availability, and booking details. To make the system more user-friendly, you can use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and add some interactive features like calendar views, search filters, and real-time updates.

Overall, this project can be a great learning experience for beginners to practice their Python skills and gain hands-on experience with web development.
